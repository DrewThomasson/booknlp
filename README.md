# BookNLP

A natural language processing pipeline for analyzing works of fiction, including entity detection, quotation attribution, and character relationship analysis.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Virtual environment (recommended)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/booknlp.git
cd booknlp
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Install the spaCy model:
```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

## Usage

1. Make sure your virtual environment is activated:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Run BookNLP on a text file:
```bash
./run_booknlp.py input_file.txt --output-dir output/directory
```

### Command Line Arguments

- `input_file`: The text file to process (required)
- `--output-dir`: Directory where output files will be saved (default: 'output')
- `--model`: Model size to use - 'big' or 'small' (default: 'small')

### Output Files

The pipeline generates several output files in the specified output directory:

1. `{book_id}.tokens`: Word-level information including:
   - Paragraph and sentence IDs
   - Word forms and lemmas
   - Part-of-speech tags
   - Dependency relations
   - Event annotations

2. `{book_id}.entities`: Named entity information including:
   - Entity types
   - Coreference IDs
   - Text spans

3. `{book_id}.quotes`: Quotation information including:
   - Quoted text
   - Speaker attribution
   - Coreference information

   - Relationships
   - Actions
   - Attributes

7. `{book_id}.book.html`: Interactive HTML visualization of the text with:
   - Entity annotations
   - Character relationships
   - Interactive features

## Example

```bash
# Process a text file named "emma.txt"
./run_booknlp.py emma.txt --output-dir output/emma
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Make sure your virtual environment is activated
2. Verify that all dependencies are installed correctly
3. Check that the spaCy model is installed
4. Ensure you have sufficient disk space for the output files
5. Make sure the input file exists and is readable
